## Ember Inspector

Ember Inspector is a Google Chrome Inspector extension for Ember developers. It displays a sidebar panel in the Inspector
which provides information about the Ember view backing the currently selected element in the DOM.
It also assigns the view object to a global variable _V which can then be used within the console for further inspecting.

### How to use it

* First, in Google Chrome, go to [chrome://flags/]("chrome://flags/") and enable Experimental Extension APIs. Relaunch your browser.

* Look in the "Downloads" section of this repository for an @ember_inspector.crx@ file, and download it if present. You will be following the process [explained in Google's documentation.]("http://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2664769&p=crx_warning")
* Open the "Extensions" window in Chrome (under the "Window" menu, select "Extensions".)
* Drag the downloaded @ember_inspector.crx@ file into the "Extensions" window.
* Approve the resulting alert.

If there is no @ember_inspector.crx@ package available, clone or export this repository and follow the instructions below:

* Open Tools-->Extensions (ensure Development mode is checked) and click on "Load unpacked extension..." to install the extension. You will need to reload Chrome once the extension is installed.
